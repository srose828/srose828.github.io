From this course, I want to learn more about software engineering not as a concept, but as an actual job. I want to know what I'm gonna be dealing with when I actually get out there, which I feel I am already learning a decent bit about. I also want to learn how to interact with other software engineers, as I know that will be a big part of my future career.

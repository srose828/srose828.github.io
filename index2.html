I am Sebastian Rose, and I just realized that I did this assignment entirely wrong the first time. I attended Oswego High School, I play guitar and football, and I watch a lot of sports. I'm a big Bills fan. Honestly I could still be doing this assignment wrong I have no idea. Hopefully it's good.

From this course I want to learn how to get a job in software engineering.
How to interact with others in a job that is largely group-based. 
I would also like to learn more about what a software engineer actually does.

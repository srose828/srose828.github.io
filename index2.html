I am Sebastian Rose, and I just realized that I did this assignment entirely wrong the first time. I attended Oswego High School, I play guitar and football, and I watch a lot of sports. I'm a big Bills fan. Honestly I could still be doing this assignment wrong I have no idea. Hopefully it's good. \nhttps://d2s742iet3d3t1.cloudfront.net/restaurants/restaurant-71477000000000000/menu/items/4/item-100000008100166854_1705438050.png?size=medium. \nhttps://www.rit.edu/study/software-engineering-bs. \nFrom this course I want to learn how to get a job in software engineering, and how to interact with others in a job that is largely group-based. I would also like to learn more about what a software engineer actually does.
